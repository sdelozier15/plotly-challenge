Use sample_values as the values for the PIE chart.

Use otu_ids as the labels for the pie chart.

Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (/samples/) to display each sample.

Use otu_ids for the x values.

Use sample_values for the y values.

Use sample_values for the marker size.

Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

Use otu_labels for the text values.

Display the sample metadata from the route /metadata/

Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
